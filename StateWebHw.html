    <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">State Website of Iowa</a></h1>
    <p>The state website of Iowa is my favorite state website, because I really like the design of the website, it looks so clean. The site also loads really fast, and the menu is easy to navigate. The codes are spaced evenly and easy to look at, and this website works perfectly in different screen sizes.</p>

    <p>The state website of Oklahoma has an overall clean design. The site also loads the fastest on my computer, and the menu is simple and easy to look for things you want. The codes for this website is well organized although I don't understand what most of the things meant. And the website works flawlessly in different screen sizes.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">State Website of Vermont</a></h1>
    <p>Vermont is a blue state and the design of the website really captures the nature beauty in this state. The menu is a simple and easy to navigate, maybe I can't tell wether the coding is good or bad, but the codes for this website look organized. Just like the other websites, this one also works well in different screen sizes.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">State Website of Alaska</a></h1>
    <p>The state website of Alaska is my least favorite state website. This website just looks too basic in my opinion, and it looks like somthing that's from 10 years ago, I noticed the spacing for codes is different through out the entire site, most importantly, this site does not work in different screen sizes, you have to scroll left and right.</p>
