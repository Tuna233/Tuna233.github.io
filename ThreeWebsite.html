    <h1>Three Website Opinion Article</h1>
    <p>The first website that I like is called <a href="https://kokokaka.com/#cat=news">"Kokokaka Creative Studio."</a><br>
    I like this website mainly because there is a playable piano on this<br> website, and the layout of this website is really clean. The code is really<br>  organized and modern, but they had too many "h1" elements,<br>  maybe they should consider using the "h1" element only as a top-level<br>  heading only. I can navigate around this website easily. They used all <br> three primary colors in this website, they had a beautiful abstract<br>  painting on top of the website, it represents the creativity of the users<br>  well. This website has a transparent menu that will disappear<br>  when you scroll down, and again there's a playable piano on<br>  the page, and that is incredible.

    <p>The second website that I really like is called <a href="https://www.yinandyangconstruction.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi7yCBhDJARIsAMWFScM0QKaJzkkh8d3bWxNJ-EKEAK25na6az2GX_VISQp9Wx3or6lJwvwAaAmOtEALw_wcB">"Yin and Yang Construction."</a><br>
    I like this website mainly because the scrolling down effects,<br> and the layout of this website is also super clean. The code looks organized,<br> but I don't understand a lot of elements they used in their website,<br> the validator says that the type attribute is unnecessary for <br>JavaScript resources. I can navigate around this website easily. They<br> used white, black, and gold in this website, the colors they <br>used are perfect for a luxury construction website. This website has<br> transparent texts that will only appear when you scroll down, <br>there's also a video behind text, that is super cool to me.

    <p>The worst website that I've ever seen is called <a href="https://yvettesbridalformal.p1r8.net/">"Yvette's."</a><br>This is the worst website mainly because how messy it is. The code looks so <br>disorganized, seems like they just put their elements wherever they<br> want as long as it works, the validator says that the website<br> has over 1000 errors. I can't find where I want to go in this<br> website. They used almost all the colors in the world, the<br> colors are just there, I don't think they are representing anything at<br> all. The impressive part about this website is how it's still<br> working, it's like this website alone is not enough to put them out of business.
